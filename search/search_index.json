For information on Siddhi and it's features refer Siddhi Documentation . Download Versions 3.x and above with group id io.siddhi.extension.* from here . Versions 2.x and lower with group id org.wso2.extension.siddhi.* from here . Latest API Docs Latest API Docs is 2.0.3 . Features cdc ( Source ) The CDC source receives events when change events (i.e., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) are triggered for a database table. Events are received in the 'key-value' format. There are two modes you could perform CDC: Listening mode and Polling mode. In polling mode, the datasource is periodically polled for capturing the changes. The polling period can be configured. In polling mode, you can only capture INSERT and UPDATE changes. On listening mode, the Source will keep listening to the Change Log of the database and notify in case a change has taken place. Here, you are immediately notified about the change, compared to polling mode. The key values of the map of a CDC change event are as follows. For 'listening' mode: For insert: Keys are specified as columns of the table. For delete: Keys are followed by the specified table columns. This is achieved via 'before_'. e.g., specifying 'before_X' results in the key being added before the column named 'X'. For update: Keys are followed followed by the specified table columns. This is achieved via 'before_'. e.g., specifying 'before_X' results in the key being added before the column named 'X'. For 'polling' mode: Keys are specified as the columns of the table. See parameter: mode for supported databases and change events. Dependencies JDBC connector jar should be added to the runtime. Download the JDBC connector jar based on the database type that is being used. For MySQL, use connector version 5.1.xx. In addition to that, there are some prerequisites that need to be met based on the CDC mode used. Please find them below. Default mode (Listening mode): Currently MySQL, PostgreSQL and SQLServer are supported in Listening Mode. To capture the change events, databases have to be configured as shown below. MySQL - https://debezium.io/docs/connectors/mysql/#setting-up-mysql PostgreSQL - https://debezium.io/docs/connectors/postgresql/#setting-up-PostgreSQL SQLServer - https://debezium.io/docs/connectors/sqlserver/#setting-up-sqlserver Polling mode: Change data capturing table should be have a polling column. Auto Incremental column or Timestamp can be used. Please see API docs for more details about change data capturing modes. Installation For installing this extension on various siddhi execution environments refer Siddhi documentation section on adding extensions .

F=The format used is: 'jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<database_name>' STRING No No mode Mode to capture the change data. The type of events that can be received, and the required parameters differ based on the mode. The mode can be one of the following: 'polling': This mode uses a column named 'polling.column' to monitor the given table. It captures change events of the 'RDBMS', 'INSERT, and 'UPDATE' types. 'listening': This mode uses logs to monitor the given table. It currently supports change events only of the 'MySQL', 'INSERT', 'UPDATE', and 'DELETE' types. listening STRING Yes No jdbc.driver.name The driver class name for connecting the database. It is required to specify a value for this parameter when the mode is 'polling'. STRING Yes No username The username to be used for accessing the database. This user needs to have the 'SELECT', 'RELOAD', 'SHOW DATABASES', 'REPLICATION SLAVE', and 'REPLICATION CLIENT'privileges for the change data capturing table (specified via the 'table.name' parameter). To operate in the polling mode, the user needs 'SELECT' privileges. STRING No No password The password of the username you specified for accessing the database. STRING No No pool.properties The pool parameters for the database connection can be specified as key-value pairs. STRING Yes No datasource.name Name of the wso2 datasource to connect to the database. When datasource name is provided, the URL, username and password are not needed. A datasource based connection is given more priority over the URL based connection. This parameter is applicable only when the mode is set to 'polling', and it can be applied only when you use this extension with WSO2 Stream Processor. STRING Yes No table.name The name of the table that needs to be monitored for data changes. STRING No No polling.column The column name that is polled to capture the change data. It is recommended to have a TIMESTAMP field as the 'polling.column' in order to capture the inserts and updates. Numeric auto-incremental fields and char fields can also be used as 'polling.column'. However, note that fields of these types only support insert change capturing, and the possibility of using a char field also depends on how the data is input. It is required to enter a value for this parameter when the mode is 'polling'. STRING Yes No polling.interval The time interval (specified in seconds) to poll the given table for changes. This parameter is applicable only when the mode is set to 'polling'. 1 INT Yes No operation The change event operation you want to carry out. Possible values are 'insert', 'update' or 'delete'. It is required to specify a value when the mode is 'listening'. This parameter is not case sensitive. STRING No No connector.properties Here, you can specify Debezium connector properties as a comma-separated string. The properties specified here are given more priority over the parameters. This parameter is applicable only for the 'listening' mode. Empty_String STRING Yes No database.server.id An ID to be used when joining MySQL database cluster to read the bin log. This should be a unique integer between 1 to 2^32. This parameter is applicable only when the mode is 'listening'. Random integer between 5400 and 6400 STRING Yes No database.server.name A logical name that identifies and provides a namespace for the database server. This parameter is applicable only when the mode is 'listening'. {host}_{port} STRING Yes No wait.on.missed.record Indicates whether the process needs to wait on missing/out-of-order records. When this flag is set to 'true' the process will be held once it identifies a missing record. The missing recrod is identified by the sequence of the polling.column value. This can be used only with number fields and not recommended to use with time values as it will not be sequential. This should be enabled ONLY where the records can be written out-of-order, (eg. concurrent writers) as this degrades the performance. false BOOL Yes No missed.record.waiting.timeout The timeout (specified in seconds) to retry for missing/out-of-order record. This should be used along with the wait.on.missed.record parameter. If the parameter is not set, the process will indefinitely wait for the missing record. -1 INT Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @source(type = 'cdc' , url = 'jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/SimpleDB', username = 'cdcuser', password = 'pswd4cdc', table.name = 'students', operation = 'insert', @map(type='keyvalue', @attributes(id = 'id', name = 'name'))) define stream inputStream (id string, name string); In this example, the CDC source listens to the row insertions that are made in the 'students' table with the column name, and the ID.

Events are received in the 'key-value' format. There are two modes you could perform CDC: Listening mode and Polling mode. In polling mode, the datasource is periodically polled for capturing the changes. The polling period can be configured. In polling mode, you can only capture INSERT and UPDATE changes. On listening mode, the Source will keep listening to the Change Log of the database and notify in case a change has taken place. Here, you are immediately notified about the change, compared to polling mode. The key values of the map of a CDC change event are as follows. For 'listening' mode: For insert: Keys are specified as columns of the table. For delete: Keys are followed by the specified table columns. This is achieved via 'before_'. e.g., specifying 'before_X' results in the key being added before the column named 'X'. For update: Keys are followed followed by the specified table columns. This is achieved via 'before_'. e.g., specifying 'before_X' results in the key being added before the column named 'X'. For 'polling' mode: Keys are specified as the columns of the table.

QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic url The connection URL to the database. F=The format used is: 'jdbc:mysql://<host>:<port>/<database_name>' STRING No No mode Mode to capture the change data. The type of events that can be received, and the required parameters differ based on the mode. The mode can be one of the following: 'polling': This mode uses a column named 'polling.column' to monitor the given table. It captures change events of the 'RDBMS', 'INSERT, and 'UPDATE' types. 'listening': This mode uses logs to monitor the given table.
